I am an observational astrophysicist who studies the growth of cosmic structure and galaxy evolution using large survey data. 

Some specific projects I have been working on are listed below.

<h2 id="Multi-probe cluster cosmology">Multi-probe cluster cosmology from galaxy survey</h2>
<p align="justify">
I develop and validate a novel method for cluster cosmology, which not only provides a way to constrain cosmology using photometrically-selected galaxy clusters but also enables the combination of cluster abundances and other cosmological probes in wide imaging surveys.
 Specifically, I propose to jointly model the abundance of galaxy clusters and large-scale two-point correlations, namely galaxy clustering, galaxy–cluster cross-correlations, cluster clustering, and cluster lensing. I have led this analysis for DES-Y1 (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200810757T/abstract">To, Krause et al. 2020a</a>, <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PhRvL.126n1301T/abstract">To, Krause et al. 2020b</a>) and DES-Y3 (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025PhRvD.112f3537T/abstract">To et al. 2025</a>, <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025PhRvD.112h3535A/abstract">DES et al. 2025</a>). I am now leading the final DES analysis of clusters, galaxies, weak lensing, and SN to test evolving dark energy.

<h2 id ="Machine learning based likelihood evaluation tools"> Machine learning based likelihood evaluation tools </h2>
To efficiently perform likelihood analysis for cosmological surveys, we develop a neural network based MCMC inference tools (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023JCAP...01..016T/abstract">To et al. 2022</a>). We validate the performance of the tools on DES-Y1 data as well as LSST Y10 simulated data.

When  using  properties  of  galaxies  to  elucidate  the  properties  of  dark  matter  and  hence to  constrain  cosmological  parameters,  it  is  crucial  to  understand  the  connection  between galaxies and their host dark matter halos.

<p align="justify">
I have constrained this connection at high masses with galaxy clusters in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...897...15T/abstract"> To et al. (2020b) </a>) and at low masses with dwarf galaxies in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI; <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv250920458T/abstract"> To et al. (2025b) </a>), using state-of-the-art weak-lensing mass calibration with careful systematics control.
