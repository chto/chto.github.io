Hi and welcome!

I am an astrophysicist and a CCAPP postdoctoral fellow at <a href="https://ccapp.osu.edu/people/to.87">the Ohio State University</a>.  
<p class="text-justify">
My main research interests are studying how structure grows in the universe, how structure growth affects galaxy's evolution, how to use galaxy as a probe of the nature of dark energy, and how to combine multiple probes of dark energy to yield best constraints. I use dark matter simulations, empirical models of galaxy-halo connections, theory, and deep survey data to tackle these questions.
</p>
While I am not doing research, I enjoy playing badminton and biking.
